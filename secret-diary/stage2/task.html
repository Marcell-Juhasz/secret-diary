<h2>Description</h2>

<p>At the second stage, you have to add two useful functionalities to your application. First of all, the diary should save all the notes, not only the last one. On the other hand, the user may want to see when each note is created, so you need to attach the date and time of creation to the writings.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Change the functionality of the save button. When it is tapped, the new writing should be appended to the top of the diary with the date and time of its creation.</li>
    <li>The date and time come first with the following format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss. The saved text should appear in the next line.</li>
    <li>Each note should be separated by an empty line.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Obs: The passage of time will be emulated on tests.
    There are several time related apis in java/kotlin/android environment,
    but tests time emulation won't guarantee to be compatible with all of them.
</p>

<p>
    You can use <code>Clock.System.now()</code>
    which will be guaranteed to be compatible with tests time emulation.
