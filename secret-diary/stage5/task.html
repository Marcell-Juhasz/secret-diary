<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The diary is ready to use, well done! But since we may write down our secrets, do not want others to access and read them. So, the last step is to protect the diary with a password that only the user knows.</p>

<p>To do this, you have to create a new <code>Activity</code> for the PIN, which is shown when the application is launched. If the user correctly enters the secret number, then tap the Log In button, they can access the diary and work with it like in the previous stage. If the PIN is incorrect, let the user know by showing an error message.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>1. Create a new <code>Activity</code> named "LoginActivity" with the following components and set it to be the launcher activity:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A <code>TextView</code> with <code>id</code> &quot;tvTitle&quot; and <code>text</code> &quot;Secret Diary&quot;</li>
    <li>An <code>EditText</code> with <code>id</code> attribute set to &quot;etPin&quot; that only accepts numeric input. Also, a <code>hint</code> &quot;Enter PIN&quot; should inform the user about the role of the input field.</li>
    <li>A <code>Button</code> with &quot;btnLogIn&quot; <code>id</code> and &quot;Log In&quot; <code>text</code> property</li>
</ul>

<p>2. If the user presses the <code>Log In</code> button and the entered PIN is correct (PIN: 1234), launch the diary Activity you already implemented in the previous stages. Otherwise set the <code>error</code> property of the input text field to &quot;Wrong PIN!&quot;</p>
