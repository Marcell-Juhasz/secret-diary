<h2>Description</h2>

<p>We have created a nice diary so far. The user can add as many notes as they want, and remove the last one. But the application should also be able to persistently save the data, and that is what you have to implement in that stage.<span style="color:#64b0f4"> </span>When the application is being closed, all the diary text should be saved including the date and time notations. When the user launches the application, they should see the diary exactly as before it was closed. Also,&nbsp; <code>Save</code> and <code>Undo</code> buttons should work as before.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
    <li>&nbsp;Save the diary persistently to survive the application closes.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;When the user launches the app, the saved diary should be loaded automatically.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;The two buttons should work like in the previous stage, also for the notes loaded from persistent storage.</li>
</ol>
