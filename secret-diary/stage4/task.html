<h2>Description</h2>

<p>You have created a lovely diary so far. Users can add as many notes as they want and remove the last one. The application, however, should also be able to save the data; that is what you must implement in this stage.<span style="color: #64b0f4;"> </span>When the application is closed by users, all the diary text data should be saved, including the date and time notations. Users should see the diary precisely as it was when they restart the application. The <code>Save</code> and <code>Undo</code> buttons should work as before.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Save the diary into <code>SharedPreferences</code> with the name <code>PREF_DIARY</code> and the key <code>KEY_DIARY_TEXT</code> to display it once the application closes. Save the diary after each <code>Save</code> and <code>Undo</code> action;</li>
    <li>When the user restarts the app, load the saved diary automatically;</li>
    <li>The two buttons should work like in the previous stage; the same applies to the notes loaded from the storage.</li>
</ol>
